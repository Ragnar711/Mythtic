<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0921151836_10.jpg" alt="void">
<hr>
<p>
In the beginning there was only chaos, an empty void. Then this void gave birth to Gaea (Mother eaarth), Tartarus (A great region beneath earth), and Eros ( God of love and attraction). Chaos also bore Erebus (Darkness of the netherworld), and Night (Darkness over the earth). The two slept together and gave birth to Ether (The heavenly night) and Day (The earthly light). Later Night alone produced Doom, Fate, Sleep, Death, Dreams, Nemesis, and many other creatures.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Gaea gave birth to Uranus (The sky), Pontus (The sea), and the mountains. Because Uranus surrounded Gaea he became her lover and the primordial couple produced the twelve titans, the three one eyed cyclopes, and the three terrible Hecatoncheires with fifty heads and hundred arms.
</p>
<p>
However Uranus proved himself as a terrible father, he hated the hecatoncheires and they hated him in return, so he pushed them back into Gaea's womb, she was in extreme pain so she plotted revenge upon him. She fashioned a flint sickle and called her sons but the only one who was brave enough to face Uranos, was the last born titan Cronos.
</p>
<p>
One night when Uranus came to sleep with Gaea, Cronos was waiting for him, and he severed his father's genitals with his mother's sickle. As the blood fell on earth the Furies, the tree nymphs and the giants were created, and from the foam of the sea arose Aphrodite, the beautiful goddess of love. Before perishing Uranus promised Cronos that the other titans would be punished.<br>Cronus sent the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires to Tartarus and established his reign. He married his sister Rhea, but he could not allow his children to survive, for both Gaea and Uranus promised him that he will be killed by his son. When Rhea gave birth to the gods and goddesses, he swallowed them, first Hestia, then Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. In pain, Rhea decided to save her last child, by hiding him and giving Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling bands to swallow instead.<br>Attended by the Nymphs, Zeus grew up on the island of Crete, and decided to take his father down, and by the help of the titaness Metis, who prepared an emetic portion, he desguised as a cupbearer, and gave the portion to Cronus, who vomited Zeus's brothers and sisters, the gods were alive and unhurt and together they managed to defet Cronus and sent him to Tartarus. 
</p>
<p>
The other titans with the exception of Oceanus and Prometheus rebelled against the gods. For ten years the war raged, until Zeus went down to Tartarus and released the Cyclopes and the hecatoncheires. The Cyclopes awarded Zeus their weapons of thunder and lightening, and the Hecatoncheires pelted the titans with boulders. And at last the titans were defeated and imprisoned in Tartarus, but not the titan Atlas the leader of the rebellion, Zeus condemned his to stand forever at the edge of the world and bear the heavens on his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Gaea was enraged by the fall of her children, and through her reunion with Tartarus she gave birth to one last monster Typhon, a terrible beast that never rested. Terrified the gods fled to Egypt and turned into animals but Athena accused Zeus of being a coward so he decided to face the mighty monster, and by hurling lightning at it again and again managed to defeat it and buried it under mount Etna in Sicily. After that, there was one last attempt to dethrone Zeus by the giants that arose from Uranus blood but with the help of the mortal Heracles, they were defeated, and the rule of the Olympians was undisputed.

<p>
Zeus assigned Prometheus and his brother Epimetheus to fill the earth with creatures so it wouldn't be so barren.<br>Epimetheus created the animals of the world and gave them all the gifts(horns, sheels,etc). So nothing was left for men. Prometheus then created man out of clay and based it on the form of the gods, and gave them the mind. Thus making them superior to the other animals, they were physically helpless, so he asked Zeus if he could give them some of the sacred fire of Olympus but Zeus denied.<br>Prometheus waasn't happy, so he stole some of the fire and gave it to humans.

<h3>Patron God Of Athens</h3>
<p>There once came a time in Ancient Greece when the first king of Athens, Cecrops, who was half person and half snake, had to find a patron deity for the city state of Athens.

The two Olympian gods who were particularly interested in the patronage were Poseidon, the god of the Seas and Athena, the goddess of Wisdom and Skill. They presented themselves in front of Cecrops and Cecrops asked from them to offer a gift truly valuable for Athens.

Poseidon came first: he struck the earth powerfully and created a well with his trident. Immediately, streaming water shot forth, but the water turned out to be salty and not very useful for the population.

Next, it was the turn of goddess Athena. Athena stepped forward, struck her spear into the ground and then she kneeled and planted an olive branch in it. This way she created an olive tree, as a symbolization of peace and prosperity on earth.

Cecrops was very impressed by Athena’s gift. So he chose <span style="color:white">Athena</span> to lay claim of the city of Athens and the city was named after her. God Poseidon, however, was not pleased with the decision of Cecrops and cursed the city of Athens to never have enough water from then on. After that, it is said that a major problem of water shortage started in Athens, which continues until nowadays.
</p>
<h3>Poseidon and Medusa</h3>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jlaOiNXRyU4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Medusa">
<p>
Medusa was a priestess to the goddess Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom and battle. One requirement to be a priestess for Athena is that the young woman must be a virgin and give her life to the goddess. One day, Poseidon, the god of the Sea and rival to Athena, saw Medusa and decided to humiliate Athena by raping the priestess on the steps of Athena's temple. Poseidon vanished after he was done and left Medusa vulnerable and weak.<br>Medusa prayed to Athena for guidance and forgiveness. After all, in those days, the gods claimed their mates as their partner forever, and Medusa was now Poseidon's wife. Athena looked down in anger and cursed Medusa for betraying her. Medusa was sent to a faraway island and was cursed so that no man would want her. She was given chicken legs, giant metal wings, cracked skin, madness, and her signature snake hair and stone eyes. Medusa was now a monster woman.</p>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJ67zSDVAAAWwNo.jpg" alt="Medusa2">
<p>Medusa was banished from civilization to an island by herself. She was alone and only saw men chase her, trying to kill her. She looked at them in fear and saw them turn to stone in front of them. She was scared of her powers and angry at the gods for cursing her. She took her revenge on the men that were sent to kill her. Anybody who took one step on her island were marked now for death at the hands of the Gorgon Medusa.<br>Years later and many men later, Perseus came to the island with a shield from Athena, flying shoes from Hermes and a sword and crown from Zeus. He outsmarted Medusa and cut off her head to take back with him to save his mother from marrying a jerk. From Medusa's body came a winged horse, Pegasus, and a golden warrior named Chrysaor. Many years later, Perseus presented the head of Medusa to Athena, who took the severed head and turned it into an ultimate shield with a metal head of Medusa terrifying many enemies with a single look.

<p>Medusa was a loyal woman who spent her youth training to become a priestess to a goddess she worshiped and believed was the strongest of all the Olympians. Athena also liked Medusa because Medusa was a beautiful woman who chose the goddess instead of any man. However, the immortal feud between Athena and Poseidon affects much more than just those two; it splits Olympus and ruins many lives.

Their feud has 3 main spikes: the representative of Athens, the events with Odysseus, and the claiming of Medusa. Medusa, after being raped, was cursed for betraying her goddess. Medusa's destiny was a harsh one she had no control over. However, she does spend all her life with Athena, as she protects her goddess against many foes. So, in a twisted series of events, Medusa fulfills her role of protecting Athena. However, it also led to snakes hating mankind for worshiping the Olympians. This is one story that shows the cruelty of the Greek Gods.

<h3>The Cretan Bull</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Herculean_effort.jpg/220px-Herculean_effort.jpg" alt="The Cretan Bull">
<p>
Minos was king in Crete. In order to confirm his right to rule, rather than any of his brothers, he prayed Poseidon send him a snow-white bull as a sign. Poseidon sent Minos the bull, with the understanding that it would be sacrificed to the god. Deciding that Poseidon's bull was too fine of a specimen to kill, Minos sent it to his herds and substituted another, inferior bull for sacrifice. Enraged, Poseidon had Aphrodite cause Pasiphaė, wife of Minos, to fall in love with the bull. She subsequently gave birth to the half-man, half-bull, Minotaur. Poseidon passed on his rage to the bull, causing it lay waste the land.

<h3>The Wall Of Troy</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/44/21/ff4421e25f868cb19c633a80219399be.jpg" alt="Troy">
<p>
After offending Zeus, the gods Apollo and Poseidon were told to serve Laomedon by building the walls of Troy. Laomedon told the gods he would reward them generously, a promise he did not keep in the end. The gods, angry, sent a plague and a sea monster to destroy the city.

<h2 id="hades">Hades</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*C7KE9ATBZfqR1AAB.jpg" alt="Hades">
<hr>
<p>
Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.
</p>
<h3>His Role</h3>
<p>
Hades means “The Unseen One” – a suitable name since Hades is the ruler of the invisible world. However, the Ancient Greeks rarely used this name – just like Christians rarely used the word “Hell” during the Middle Ages. So, since minerals and precious metals are found underground, they often referred to Hades euphemistically as Plouton – namely, “The Wealth-Giver.” Unsurprisingly, Hades’ Roman equivalent is called Pluto as well.<br>As the ruler of the dead, Hades was a grim and ghastly figure, inspiring awe and terror in everybody. Consequently, he was rarely depicted in art. When he was, he was most commonly portrayed with a beard, and a solemn, mournful look. He frequently wears a helmet, named the Helm of Darkness or the Cap of Invisibility. Cerberus, the three-headed dog which guarded the entrance to the Underworld, is usually beside him. Every so often he carries a scepter or holds the key to his kingdom. At a later stage, he became associated with his weapon of choice, the bident, a two-pronged fork modeled after Poseidon’s trident. As Plouton, he was sometimes shown with a cornucopia, the horn of plenty.
</p>
<h3>Birth and the Titanomachy</h3>
<p>
Hades was the fourth child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea (after Hestia, Demeter, and Hera), both the oldest and the youngest male sibling. In other words, he was the first of the three brothers (Hades, Poseidon, Zeus) to be born and swallowed by his father, but the last one to be regurgitated.

After being rescued by Zeus from the belly of Cronus, Hades joins him in the Titanomachy. Eventually, the decade-long war ends with a victory for the Olympians. Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus cast lots to decide who of the brothers will rule which domain. Hades gets the underworld.
</p>
<h3>The Abduction of Persephone</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/0d/5d/690d5de8e25c5c5f171b2630bae80b39.jpg" alt="Persephone">
<p>
Since Hades was a fearsome deity who rarely left his kingdom, there are very few myths about him in Ancient Greek sources.

By far the most important myth is Hades’ abduction of Persephone, Demeter’s daughter. That was one of the few times Hades traveled above ground. The reason, naturally, was love: he fell for Persephone. However, Persephone didn’t want to give in easily, so Hades devised an ingenious ploy. As Persephone was gathering flowers with her maidens at the Nysian plain, he caused an indescribably beautiful flower to suddenly bloom before her. When Persephone reached out to pluck it, the ground under her opened and Hades appeared before her, all dreadful and majestic in his four-horse golden chariot and took her with him to the Underworld.

Demeter, the goddess of fertility, was so distressed at the absence of her daughter, that she started fasting and wandering aimlessly. Finally, after nine days, Hecate told her what happened. After the All-Seeing Helios confirmed the event, Demeter left Olympus as an act of protest against the injustice done to her.

With her gone, the earth was as barren and infertile as a desert. One year passed, and the gods started worrying that the famine would wipe out humanity. So Zeus sent all the gods, one by one, to beg Demeter to come back, promising her all kinds of gifts and functions. She wanted none; the only thing she wanted was to see her daughter once again.

So, Zeus had no choice but to send Hermes to Hades with the request that he return Persephone to Demeter. He complied, but only after making Persephone eat one pomegranate seed before leaving. This ensured that she would remain bound to his kingdom eternally.

Now, both sides had no choice but to accept Zeus’ compromise: Persephone would spend two-thirds of the year with her mother, but one-third of it with Hades. And this is the part of the year which corresponds with the winter months: they say that Demeter retreats from Olympus to her temple at Eleusis to grieve the absence of Persephone.

It’s possible that Hades and Persephone didn’t have any children. However, some say that Zagreus may have been their son. Macaria is also claimed to have been Hades’ daughter – but no mother is mentioned.

<h2 id="hera">Hera</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/49/80/1b/49801b98b6c9d85fe7a3e41b322c65f2.png" alt="Hera">
<hr>
<p>
Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.
</p>
<h3>Her Role</h3>
<p>
Based on the number of cults, Hera was a very ancient goddess, possibly predating even Zeus. In fact, it’s assumed that we don’t even know her original name. “Hera” is actually a title, which is usually translated as “Lady” or “Mistress.” Hera’s Roman counterpart was Juno, the goddess who gave her name to the month of June, even today, the most popular time for weddings.
Hera was usually portrayed alongside Zeus, as a fully clothed matronly woman of solemn beauty, wearing a cylindrical crown called polos or a wreath and a veil. Sometimes she carries a scepter capped with a pomegranate and a cuckoo – the former a symbol of fertility, the latter a token of the way she was wooed by Zeus. She is also often accompanied by a peacock, one of her sacred animals.
</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>
Being born after Hestia and Demeter, Hera is the youngest of Cronus’ and Rhea’s three daughters and their third child overall; Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus – in that order – are her younger brothers. However, since just like each of her siblings but Zeus, she was swallowed by her father at birth and later disgorged to be born again, she is sometimes referred to as Cronus’ and Rhea’s oldest daughter. Reasonably, since the Titan had to empty his stomach of his children in the order opposite of the one in which he ate them.
</p>
<h3>The Archetypal Married Couple: Hera and Zeus</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/14/7a/1d/147a1df24b5cf1de82d01e689ee4e54f.jpg" alt="Hera and Zeus">
<p>
As the guardian of marriage and the spouse of the King of Gods and Men, Hera didn’t have much choice but to be a faithful wife. Even though she was beautiful, not many men – and not one god – dared to lay hands on her. Endymion tried once, but Zeus condemned him to eternal sleep. Ixion fared even worse: Zeus fooled him into making love with a cloud fashioned in Hera’s image, and then ordered Hermes to bind him to a perpetually turning wheel of fire.

By most accounts, Hera gave Zeus four children: Ares, the god of war, Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, Hebe, the goddess of eternal youth, and Hephaestus, the god of fire.
</p>
<h3>Hera, a Vengeful Wife</h3>
<h4>The Wooing of Hera</h4>
<p>Zeus tricked Hera into marriage. Knowing full well that the goddess loved animals, he transformed himself into a distressed cuckoo and reverted to his original form only when Hera took the poor creature to her breast to warm it. Ashamed for being taken advantage of, Hera agreed to a marriage.
</p>
<h4>Hera Challenges Zeus</h4>
<p>However, it didn’t turn out to be a happy one. Zeus was brutish and cruel to everybody. Incapable of bearing this, Hera plotted a revenge plan with Poseidon, Athena and possibly few other gods. She drugged Zeus, and they bound him on his bed, while stealing his thunderbolt. Thetis, however, summoned Briareus and he managed to quickly untie Zeus, who was, subsequently, merciless to the main schemer: he hung Hera from the sky with golden chains.

To grant herself a release, Hera swore to never rebel again against her husband. So, she directed her anger toward Zeus’s lovers and their offspring, becoming a jealous and vindictive wife.
</p>
<h4>Hera and Semele</h4>
<p>For example, she tricked Semele into forcing her lover – which she knew was Zeus – to reveal himself before her in all his glory. Since humans can’t look upon at gods without incinerating, Semele perished into thin air.
</p>
<h4>Hera and Callisto</h4>
<p>Later, she turned Callisto into a bear, after the latter gave birth to Zeus’ child Arcas. After some time, just as Arcas was about to unwittingly kill his mother, Zeus placed Callisto and her son in the sky as the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Big and the Little Bear.
</p>
<h4>Hera and the Delaying of Births</h4>
<p>Hera kept her daughter Eileithyia from attending the birth of Apollo, postponing it by nine days and nights. More famously, she did the same with Heracles; in this case, the delay caused Heracles the throne of Argolid.
</p>
<h4>Hera and Io</h4>
<p>Arguably, Io was the one who endured the most. First Zeus transformed her into a cow so that he can hide her from Hera. Then, Hera sent Argus Panoptes to watch over her, and Zeus – Hermes to kill him. After that, Hera transformed Argus’ ghost into a gadfly which bothered Io in her bovine form all the way to Egypt. Finally, Zeus impregnated her there with Epaphus.

<h3>Hera, the Vain Goddess</h3>

<p>
Just like most of the other Greek goddesses, when it came to her beauty, Hera was easily offended.

Once, Orion’s wife Side (“pomegranate”) boasted that she was as beautiful as Hera, so the goddess sent her to the Underworld. When Laomedon’s daughter Antigone did the same, Hera turned her into a stork. Finally, after Paris chose Aphrodite instead of her, she became a sworn enemy of Troy.

<h2 id="aphrodite">Aphrodite</h2>

<p>
Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.
</p>
<h3>Her Role</h3>
<p>
Aphrodite’s name is usually linked to the Ancient Greek word for “sea-foam,” aphros, which fits nicely with the story of her birth. However, modern scholars think that both Aphrodite and her name predate Ancient Greece and that the story actually came because of the goddess’ name.<br>
If Apollo represented the ideal of the perfect male body to the Greeks, Aphrodite was certainly his most appropriate female counterpart. Beautiful and enchanting, she was frequently depicted nude, as a symmetrically perfect maiden, infinitely desirable and as infinitely out of reach. She was sometimes represented alongside Eros and with some of her major attributes and symbols: a magical girdle and a shell, a dove or a sparrow, roses, and myrtles.<br>
Once, during an important religious festival, the hetaera Phryne decided to swim naked in the sea. The famous painter Apelles was so overwhelmed by the exquisite sight that he drew the most famous (now lost) painting of the Ancient World: “Aphrodite Rising from the Sea.” Many artists have tried recreating it during the centuries past. The sculptor Praxiteles had a bit more luck than Apelles: he also modeled his most celebrated sculpture of Aphrodite after Phryne, but a copy of that sculpture has survived to this day. It is one of the first life-sized female nudes in history. Plato says that when Aphrodite saw the sculpture, "Alas!" said she, "where did Praxiteles see me naked?"<br>
Worshipped by basically everybody, Aphrodite, “the One who rises from the sea” was appropriately called Pandemos, “of all the people.” However, she was also called Ourania or “heavenly,” so some Greek moralists tried to make a distinction between these two Aphrodites, claiming that Aphrodite Pandemos is the goddess of sexual desire and Aphrodite Ourania, the one of “platonic love.” Now we know that this was the same goddess, called by numerous other contradictory epithets as well, which often describe the complex nature of love: “smile-loving,” “merciful,” and the “One who postpones old age,” but also “unholy,” “the dark one,” “the killer of men.”
</p>
<h3>Her Birth</h3>
<p>
 Aphrodite was born when Uranus’ genitals fell into the sea after he was castrated by his son Cronus. The goddess of love emerged from the waters on a scallop shell, fully-grown, nude, and more beautiful than anything anyone had ever seen before or since.
</p>
<h3>The Almighty Aphrodite: The Goddess Even Gods Can’t Resist</h3>
<h4>Aphrodite Married to Hephaestus</h4>
<img src="https://eiriniligia.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hephaestus_and_aphrod.jpg?w=379" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
Aphrodite was so lovely that only the three virgin goddesses – Artemis, Athena, and Hestia – were immune to her charms and power. Unsurprisingly, the second she got on Olympus, she inadvertently wreaked havoc amongst the other gods, each of whom instantly wanted to have her for himself. So as to prevent this, Zeus hurriedly married her to Hephaestus, the ugliest among the Olympians. Of course, this merely alleviated the problem: Aphrodite didn’t plan to remain faithful.
</p>
<h4>Aphrodite and Ares</h4>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/6b/ec/f86becc23dcc2dbcd73aeba4e858d832.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
So, she started an affair with someone as destructive and as violent as herself: Ares. Helios, however, saw them and informed Hephaestus, after which the cuckolded god made sure to devise a fine bronze net, which ensnared the couple the next time they lay together in bed. To add insult to injury, Hephaestus called upon all the other gods to laugh at the adulterers and freed them only after Poseidon agreed to pay for their release.
</p>
<h4>Aphrodite and Poseidon</h4>
<img src="https://www.akg-images.fr/Docs/AKG/Media/TR3_WATERMARKED/f/6/0/e/AKG1090802.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
Poor Hephaestus! He couldn’t have known that when Poseidon saw Aphrodite naked, he fell in love with her all over again. He must have found out later, since Aphrodite gave Poseidon at least one daughter, Rhode. And she didn’t give up on Ares either! In fact, after the bronze net scandal, she bore the god of war as many as eight children: Deimos, Phobos, Harmonia, Adrestia and the four Erotes (Eros, Anteros, Pothos, and Himeros).
</p>
<h4>Aphrodite and Hermes</h4>
<img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YKp4YVTvPLw/THWEOG8EkXI/AAAAAAAABdA/UQWTD3Kpp1U/s1600/V%C3%A9nus,+Mercure+et+L%27Amour+Le+Corr%C3%A8ge.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
Hermes didn’t have many consorts, but he did have Aphrodite at least once, as the very name of their offspring, Hermaphrodites, suggests. And if we take into account that Priapus is usually considered a son of Dionysus and Aphrodite, it seems that only Zeus and Hades managed to never fall for the goddess of love. But the second one didn’t even live on Olympus, and the former may have been her father.
</p>
<h3>Aphrodite Among the Mortals</h3>
<p>
When she wasn’t busy making other people fall in love, Aphrodite had some time to fall in love herself.
</p>
<h4>Adonis</h4>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/20/84/5020847c0d4995b02da92f57fc21cee4.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
Once, she took a baby boy she had found beside a myrrh tree to the Underworld and asked Persephone to take good care of him. However, when she went to visit him after many years, she instantly fell in love with the now unusually handsome mortal. So, he asked to have Adonis – for that was the boy’s name – back. Persephone wouldn’t allow this. Zeus settled the quarrel by dividing Adonis’ time between the two goddesses. However, Adonis preferred Aphrodite and, when the time came, he didn’t want to go back to the Underworld. Persephone sent a wild boar to kill him, and Adonis bled to death in Aphrodite’s arms. The couple had two children: Beroe and Golgos.
</p>
<h4>Anchises</h4>
<img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wqgvIxvT0Zw/VVSN0jzNkRI/AAAAAAAACu0/Eip-6GcbHF4/s1600/01GREEKMYTHOLOGY.....Anchises.jpg" alt="Anchises">
<p>
Another time, Aphrodite fell for a Trojan prince called Anchises. Pretending to be a princess herself, she seduced him and slept with him. Only afterward she revealed herself, promising him a noble son and warning him to keep the affair to himself. Anchises wasn’t able to, so he was struck by Zeus’ thunderbolt which blinded him. And he wasn’t able to see his son, Aeneas, found the mighty Roman Empire.
</p>
<h4>Paris</h4>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/19/dc/be19dc9c07c730e190adac02b42ed972.jpg" alt="Paris">
<p>
Paris was the third and final mortal who was blessed with seeing Aphrodite naked. This happened when he was tasked with judging who of the three goddesses – Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena – was the fairest. Aphrodite promised Paris the most beautiful girl in the world if he chose her, so, naturally, he did. Aphrodite made sure that he gets Helen, the Spartan queen, an event which triggered the bloody decade-long Trojan War.
</p>
<h3>Aphrodite, the Unforgiving: Hippolytus, Eos, Diomedes, Psyche</h3>
<img src="https://moscsp.ru/uploads/218b6d4ef4d6461abc1413f9e0b6c8d8.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
<p>
Few dared to resist the power of Aphrodite, and she had mercy for none of them. Hippolytus preferred Artemis to her and vowed to eternal innocence. Aphrodite made his stepmother Phaedra fall in love with him, which resulted in the death of both her and Hippolytus.

After Aphrodite found out that Eos had slept with Ares, she cursed her to be perpetually – and unhappily – in love. Diomedes wounded the goddess during the Trojan War, and suddenly his wife Aegiale started sleeping around with his enemies.

Psyche would have gone through an even worse ordeal, but, fortunately for her, Eros – Aphrodite’s avenger – shot himself instead of her and fell in love with Psyche instead.

<h2 id="athena">Athena</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://s1.thingpic.com/images/Bj/uK6YNck31nfPu3bjz3QZei8k.jpeg" alt="Athena">
<hr>
<p>
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice.
</p>
<h3>Her Role</h3>
<p>
Athena’s name is closely linked with the name of the city of Athens. The Ancient Greeks debated whether she got her name after the city or the other way around. Modern scholars usually agree that the former was the case.<br>
In art and literature, Athena is usually depicted as a majestic lady, with a beautiful, but stern face, unsmiling full lips, grey eyes and a graceful build, emanating power and authority. She is always regally clad in either a chiton or a full armor. In the former case, she is sometimes represented with a spindle. In the latter case, she wears an elaborately crested Corinthian helmet and holds a long spear in one hand and an aegis in the other.<br>
At the center of her aegis there’s oftentimes an image of a Gorgon’s head (Gorgoneion), symbolizing the gift she got from Perseus: the head of Medusa. Just like Medusa’s eyes, Athena’s shield can also turn her enemies to stone. As a symbol of her wisdom, there’s sometimes an owl flying in Athena’s vicinity or sitting on her shoulder; from time to time there may also be a snake or an olive branch.<br>
Athena was one of the most important Olympian gods and she had many functions. Unsurprisingly, she was known under many different epithets. Some of the most famous were “Virgin,” “Pallas,” “The Unwearying One,” “The One of the City,” “The One with gleaming eyes” and “The One who fights in front.”
</p>
<h3>Athena’s Early Life</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/a9/60/0e/a9600ede05cf6c1c2b15b52611a1d678.jpg" alt="Athena">
<p>
Athena was born in most miraculous circumstances. On learning that Metis’ next child may overthrow him, Zeus swallowed his first wife who was already pregnant with Athens. When the time came, Zeus started feeling tremendous headaches. As even he couldn’t bear them, Hephaestus struck him with his axe and – lo and behold! – Athena leapt out of Zeus’ head, fully armed and with a cry so mighty and fearsome that Uranus and Gaea were shaken to their bones with terror. Zeus was delighted and full of pride.<br>
As a child, Athena had a friend she loved above all. Her name was Pallas and she was all but her equal in the art of war. However, one day, as they were practicing some martial exercises, Athena accidentally killed her friend. Grief-stricken and in an attempt to preserve her memory, she added her friend’s name to her own. That’s why many people know Athena as Athena Pallas.
</p>
<h3>Athena, the Virgin Goddess</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/b6/8b/46b68bdde4a7fec063bffc3864266e13.png" alt="Athena">
<p>
Just like Artemis and Hestia, Athena was never swayed by love or passion. Consequently, she never had any children. Some say that Erichthonius was an exception, but, in fact, Athena was only his foster-mother. True, Hephaestus did try to violate her, but she fought him off, so he spilled his semen over the Earth, after which Gaea was impregnated. When Erichthonius was born, Athena took him under her wing, just like she would do afterward with another cult hero, Heracles.
</p>
<h3>Athena, the Patron of Athens</h3>
<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/509bc1_8a2b3febef7843e98a3f3fd81ceae598~mv2_d_2654_3300_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_655,h_814,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/509bc1_8a2b3febef7843e98a3f3fd81ceae598~mv2_d_2654_3300_s_4_2.webp" alt="Athena">
<p>
Poseidon and Athena had a much-publicized quarrel over who deserves to be the patron of the most prosperous Ancient Greek city, Athens. Poseidon claimed that the city would benefit more from him than Athena and to prove this, he struck his trident into a rock, creating a seawater stream which welled up in the Temple of Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis. Smart as she was, Athena did nothing spectacular: she merely planted an olive tree. However, the first king of Athens, Cecrops – who was the judge of the contest – realized that the olive tree was much more beneficial, since it gave the Athenians fruit, oil and wood.
</p>
<h3>Athena, the Patroness of Handicrafts · The Myth of Arachne</h3>
<img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/864/641/large/markus-stadlober-arachne-changing-med-02.jpg?1531828415" alt="Athena">
<p>
Athena was a master artisan. As much as she was the women counterpart of Ares as a war goddess, she was also the female equivalent of Hephaestus when it came to arts and crafts. Homer says that Athena fashioned ornate and luxuriously embroidered robes for Hera and herself. Some even say that she combined her two main interests to invent the war chariot and even the warship.<br>
However, the most famous myth which connects Athena with handicrafts is the story of Arachne, a mortal craftswoman who boasted that she was more skillful than Athena herself. Athena offered her a chance to repent, but after Arachne refused, she challenged her to a weaving duel. The goddess fashioned a beautiful tapestry which illustrated the gruesome fate of the mortals who had the hubris of challenging the gods. Arachne, on the other hand, chose for a subject the stories of the mortals unjustly victimized by the gods. She didn’t even have a chance to finish it: enraged and offended, Athena tore Arachne’s fabric to pieces and turned her into a spider. As such, Arachne is doomed to weave ever since.
</p>
<h3>Athena, the Helper of Heroes</h3>
<img src="https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/7/8/break/images-medium-5/an-audience-with-athena-kaylee-mason.jpg" alt="Athena">
<p>
As a war goddess associated with wisdom – unlike Ares who was associated with mere violence – Athena was often the main helper of Ancient Greece’s greatest heroes. Most famously, she guided Odysseus during his ten-year-long journey back to Ithaca. But, she also helped many others, such as Heracles, Perseus, Bellerophon, Jason, Diomedes, Argus, and Cadmus.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hestia">Hestia</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://i.skyrock.net/1396/90561396/pics/3262402542_1_15_d0CjDioE.jpg" alt="Hestia">
<hr>
<p>
Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, one of the original Twelve Olympians. Cronus’ and Rhea’s first-born child, she was pure and peaceful. However, since she always had to stay at home, tending the fireplace, Hestia is not involved in many myths. Consequently, at a later stage, she would be replaced in the Pantheon with the much wilder Dionysus.
</p>
<h3>Her Role</h3>
<p>
Hestia’s name means “hearth” or “fireplace,” and her status shows how important the hearth was in the social and religious life of Ancient Greeks. Making and preserving fire was both essential and difficult for more primitive societies, which made the household fire a sacred element at a very early stage of history. In later days, Hestia became its embodiment.<br>
However, there are very few pictorial representations of Hestia. Usually, she is portrayed as a modest middle-aged veil-wearing woman. Sometimes, she stands by a large fire, carrying a staff or holding some flowers in her hands.
</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>
Hestia was the first-born child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Since she was also the first one to be swallowed at birth by her father – and, consequently, the last one to be disgorged – Hestia was oftentimes called the youngest of Cronus and Rhea’s children.<br>
She had two sisters – Demeter and Hera – and three brothers: Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus.
</p>
<h3>Hestia’s Virginity, Peacefulness, and Domesticity</h3>
<h4>The Vow of Chastity</h4>
<p>
Since fire is a pure and a purifying element, Hestia was worshipped as a virgin goddess. And they say that she became a virgin in order to keep the peace at Olympus. Namely, both Apollo and Poseidon wanted to marry her; fearing that choosing either of them may result in turmoil, Hestia swore to an eternal virginity by placing her hand on Zeus’ head. As a reward for maintaining the order and in place of marriage, Zeus granted her the central place in the house and the first and richest portion of humans’ divine offerings.
</p>
<h4>Hestia, Priapus, and the Donkey</h4>
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58a2939a15d5dbaa30d8c8f8/1557948026818-U22KR9Y5YLQDOBGD2D2G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMiSB8r-7DHnFxu8mH8EmnEUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcPBNW8GJFBED1xbbxRRE208jGHAQcMBXVI6lXTD-jcSljmRf80gPMk55REE7El8Fs/05nightm.jpg" alt="Hestia">
<p>
Only once was Hestia’s chastity subsequently put in danger. At a rustic feast, the drunken god of fertility Priapus tried to rape the sleeping goddess. Fortunately, a donkey started braying and woke up both Hestia and the guests, who chased Priapus away in contempt. Ever since, donkeys were rested and garlanded on Hestia’s feast-day.
</p>
<h4>Hestia at Home</h4>
<p>
Gentle and peace-loving, Hestia doesn’t appear in too many myths other than these two. Plato says that this is because she has to remain in the house of the gods, all alone, tending the eternal celestial fire even when all the other Olympians ritually pass in processions through heavens. This is both her privilege and her predicament.<br>
Consequently, Hestia’s only manifestation among humans was the crackling of the fire. Aristotle says that it is the sound of the goddess laughing.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="artemis">Artemis</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/93/f1/e793f1104b6ab04c534bfd95083b6e61.png" alt="Artemis">
<hr>
<p>
Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity; in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her twin brother Apollo. Artemis was very protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.
</p>
<h3>Her Role</h3>
<p>
Even though Plato says that the name “Artemis” is related to her virginity and the Ancient Greek word for “unharmed” or “pure,” we now know that its origin is undoubtedly different and possibly even Persian. However, scholars can’t agree over its original meaning.<br>
Sculptors, poets, and painters, however, had no such problems. Artemis is almost universally depicted as a young, beautiful and vigorous huntress carrying a quiver with arrows and holding a bow, typically wearing a short knee-high tunic and often accompanied by some animal (stag, doe, or hunting dogs). As a moon goddess, she is sometimes represented wearing a long robe and a crescent moon crown.<br>
Homer calls Artemis either “The Mistress of Animals” or “She of the Wild.” As a huntress, she is also often referred to as “arrow-pouring” or “deer-shooting.” Just like her brother, she may be occasionally called “bright” or, even more, illustrative of her function as a moon goddess, “torch-bringer.”
</p>
<h3>Family And Birth</h3>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/84/2a/ff842ab9cb2c1b4d7c12d554cf0d92a5.jpg" alt="Artemis">
<p>
Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, herself a daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe. Angered by her husband’s infidelity, Hera hunted Leto over the whole planet and forbade her to give birth anywhere on solid earth. However, Leto got to the island of Delos and gave birth to Artemis while balancing herself on an olive branch.<br>
When Hera heard this, she prohibited her daughter Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, of further helping Leto. This postponed the birth of Apollo for nine days. And who knows how much more time it would have passed if the baby Artemis hadn’t miraculously learned the art of midwifery and helped Leto finally deliver her brother.<br>
Artemis and Apollo were very protective of their mother. When Niobe – a mother of six boys and as many girls – boasted that while Leto gave birth to two gods, she delivered a whole Olympus, Apollo and Artemis killed all her children. Apollo took care of the male offspring and Artemis of Niobe’s daughters. On another occasion, Tityus tried to rape Leto. Naturally, he was killed by Apollo’s and Artemis’s arrows.
</p>
<h3>Artemis, the Vengeful Virgin Goddess</h3>
<img src="https://breakingthehabitz.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/artemis.jpg" alt="Artemis">
<p>
When Artemis was still a little maid, she asked from her father Zeus to keep her maidenhood forever. So – just like Athena and Hestia – she remained chaste for eternity. And she guarded this vow even more vigorously than them.<br>
For example, when the hunter Actaeon saw her bathing naked, she transformed him into a stag and set his hounds against him. Needless to add, Actaeon was ripped apart to pieces. The less famous Siproites was just a boy when he had Actaeon’s misfortune of accidentally seeing the goddess unclothed. So, he was punished less severely: Artemis transformed him into a girl.<br>
Others tried to rape Artemis; none of them lived to tell. The most famous story involves Orion, a long-time hunting companion of hers. In fact, he may as well have been Artemis’ only love interest. However, when he tried taking off Artemis’ robe, the goddess killed him. Others say that Orion was actually killed by a scorpion sent by Gaea or an Apollo’s arrow; the gods merely tried to keep Artemis’ virginity intact the only time she couldn’t.
</p>
<h3>Artemis, the Defender of Purity</h3>
<p>
Artemis didn’t only take care of her own purity; she also defended the innocence of her worshippers. And was merciless if any one of her priestesses ever lost it.<br>
For example, after her hunting attendant Callisto gave birth to Zeus’s son Arcas, Artemis contrived with Hera to turn her into a bear. The plan was to have Arcas kill her. However, just as that was about to happen, Zeus placed both of them into the heavens as the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.<br>
Just as she punished the transgressors of the sacred vow, Artemis rewarded those who kept it. So as to devote himself to a chaste life, Hippolytus scorned Aphrodite after which the goddess of love made his stepmother fall in love with him. This set a chain of events which led to Hippolytus’ death. However, Artemis called upon Asclepius and resurrected Hippolytus as a new man, who subsequently ruled in Italy under the name of Virbius.<br>
In the case of Iphigenia, Artemis substituted the girl with a deer just as Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed by her father, Agamemnon. Afterward, she took Iphigenia with her in Tauris and made her a priestess of her cult.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="apollo">Apollo</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/bd/e6/9bbde62ffbfc152bd90f0e797f7a30bd.jpg" alt="Apollo">
<hr>
<p>
Apollo is the Olympian god of the sun and light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.
</p>
<h3>His Role</h3>
<p>
The origin of the name Apollo is still not properly understood. Many Greeks seem to have supposed that it stands for “destroyer,” but this was only one of the many suggestions (“redemptory,” “purifier,” “assembler,” “stony”). Modern scholars disagree with most of them, with the majority linking Apollo’s name to the Greek word apella which means “a sheepfold,” and which may suggest that Apollo was originally merely a protector of the flocks and herds.<br>
However, in time, he evolved to become a multifaceted god adored all over Greece as the perfectly developed classical male nude, the kouros. Beardless and athletically built, he is often depicted with a laurel crown on his head and either a bow and arrow or a lyre and plectrum in his hands. The sacrificial tripod – representing his prophetic powers – was another common attribute of Apollo, just as few animals linked with the god in various myths: wolf, dolphin, python, mouse, deer, swan.<br>
Apollo was in charge of so many things that, naturally, even his more famous epithets are numerous. As a sun god, he was called “Phoebus,” or “bright.” As a prophet, the Greeks called him “Loxias,” or “The One Who Speaks Crookedly.” As the god of music, he was known as the “Leader of the Muses.” Finally, the places of Apollo’s birth and worship adorned him with three other appellations: “Delian,” “Delphic,” and “Pythian.”
</p>
<h3>Apollo’s Birth and Sanctuaries · The Slaying of Python</h3>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/olympians/images/e/eb/Apollo2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140915184324" alt="Apollo">
<p>
Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto. As one of the numerous Zeus’s lovers, his mother incurred the wrath of Hera, who sent the dragon Python to pursue Leto throughout all lands and forbade her to give birth anywhere on solid earth. Nobody would accept the pregnant Titaness, except for the island of Delos, where Leto first delivered Artemis while balancing her body on an olive branch. Afterward, Artemis helped her mother deliver Apollo as well.<br>
Fed exclusively with nectar and ambrosia, in merely four days Apollo grew strong and hungry for revenge. So, he went straight away to Parnassus where Python lived, and wounded the monster with his arrows. Python managed to escape and shelter itself at Gaea’s ancient sanctuary in Delphi. Apollo was so enraged that he dared to violate the sanctity of the site by staining it with Python’s blood. Zeus ordered Apollo to cleanse himself, after which he returned to Delphi and claimed the shrine to his name.<br>
After these events, Delos and Delphi became sacred sites for the worship of Zeus, Leto, Artemis, and, especially, Apollo. The high priestess Pythia presided over the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, serving as its enigmatic oracle.
</p>
<h3>Apollo and Music</h3>
<p>
The day he was born, Hermes invented the lyre and stole Apollo’s cattle. So as to appease his older brother after he found out what happened, Hermes offered Apollo his new invention. Ever since then, the lyre became one of Apollo’s most famous attributes, and he its most celebrated master.<br>
However, Apollo’s virtuosity would be challenged on at least three different occasions. The first one to dare do such a thing was the least fortunate one, the satyr Marsyas. He wasn’t bad at all playing the aulos (the double flute), even equaling Apollo’s skill. However, he ultimately lost the contest, since, unlike Apollo, he couldn’t sing while playing. As punishment, Marsyas was hanged inside a cave and was subsequently flayed alive.<br>
Fortunately for him, Pan survived unscathed after challenging Apollo and almost unanimously losing the contest. Midas, however – the only judge who deemed that Pan was the better player – got what he deserved: asses’ ears, since he obviously lacked human ears for music in the first place.<br>
Cinyras, the King of Cyprus and a great flute player, didn’t learn anything from these two episodes. After losing his contest against Apollo, he was either killed by the god or committed suicide.<br>
</p>
<h3>Apollo’s Ill-Fated Love Affairs</h3>
<img src="https://theancienttwins.weebly.com/uploads/6/9/3/9/6939818/2348920.jpg" alt="Apollo">
<p>
Apollo was loved by both gods and humans, women and men; and, more often than not, he loved them back as well. However, as it often happens, the most famous of his love affairs are the ones which didn’t end well.<br>

Apollo and Coronis<br>
On two occasions, a mortal got the better of the god. Coronis was already pregnant with Apollo’s son Asclepius, when she fell in love with Ischys. A white crow informed Apollo of this affair which enraged Apollo so much that he ordered Artemis to kill Coronis and burned the feathers of the crow. Crows are black ever since.<br>

Apollo and Marpessa<br>
After a while, Apollo fell in love with Marpessa. Her lover Idas had already went through hell to get her, even risking his own life while abducting her. But, he didn’t back down even in front of Apollo, raising his bow and threatening him with an attack. Zeus stopped this fight and gave Marpessa the chance to choose. She chose Idas – since she feared that Apollo would stop loving her after she grows old.<br>

Apollo and Cassandra<br>
In an attempt to seduce her, Apollo gifted Cassandra, the Trojan princess, the gift of prophecy. However, afterward she backed out of the deal. Now, being a god, Apollo wasn’t allowed to recall his gift. But, he thought of a cunning idea to spoil it: he took away Cassandra’s powers of persuasion. Ever since, nobody believes her – even though her prophecies are always right.<br>

Apollo and Daphne<br>
Apollo’s most famous love interest was Daphne, a nymph who had once vowed to Artemis to remain eternally innocent. Apollo, however, fell for her and persistently stalked her, until one day Daphne couldn’t take it no more. She asked from her father, the river god Peneus, to be transformed into something else. And just as Apollo was about to embrace her, she was – into a laurel tree. The god swore to love her forever and, ever since, he wears a laurel wreath as a token of his unhappy love.<br>

Apollo and Cyparissus<br>
Both of Apollo’s most beloved male lovers were transformed into plants as well. After Cyparissus accidentally killed his pet-deer – which was gifted to him by Apollo – he asked his divine lover to let him be sorrowful forever. So, Apollo unwillingly transformed Cyparissus into a cypress tree.<br>

Apollo and Hyacinthus<br>
The story of Hyacinthus is even sadder. He was a favorite of Apollo and he dearly loved the god back. This made Zephyrus, the West Wind – a Hyacinthus’ admirer himself – so jealous that, when the pair was practicing in the fields, he made Hyacinthus’ discus swerve back and mortally wound him on the head. However, Apollo didn’t allow Hades to take all of Hyacinthus to his realm: out of his spilled blood, the god created a flower which bears his lover’s name to this day.

<h2 id="ares">Ares</h2>

<hr>
<p>
Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, he represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of wedlock.
</p>
<h3>>His Role</h3>
<p>
Quite appropriately, Ares’ name seems to have been an ancient word for battle or war.<br>
In art, Ares is usually represented wearing a helmet, a shield and either a sword or a spear. He drives a four-horse chariot and is accompanied by dogs or vultures. Sometimes, his sons Deimos and Phobos are also depicted beside him.<br>
Unlike his nobler Roman counterpart Mars, Ares was an unpopular god and never developed beyond the image of a divine battle-frenzy butcher. Consequently, only a few epithets have reached us. Unsurprisingly, few of them are flattering: “the bane of mortals,” “the slayer of men,” “the city-stormer,” “the armor-clattering,” “the arm-bearing.”
</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>
Ares was the oldest child of Zeus and Hera, and, according to those who think that Hephaestus was born through parthenogenesis, their only son. Either way, he certainly had two sisters: Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, and Hebe, the goddess of eternal youth.
</p>
<h3>Ares, the Unloved God</h3>
<p>
Since he was the savage god of senseless war, Ares was almost universally detested. At one point, after Ares is wounded in battle by Diomedes, even Zeus calls him “the most hateful of all the gods,” remarking that if he hadn’t been his son, he would have surely ended up in Tartarus with Cronus and the Titans.<br>
The episode with Diomedes is only one of many in which Ares comes off second-best in his martial encounters. During the Trojan War, Athena needs no more than one stone to floor him, after which she spends some time mocking him and bragging of her superiority as a warrior. Heracles defeats Ares not once, but twice – first during the battle of Pylos, and then after killing his son Cycnus. Most humiliatingly, Otus and Ephialtes, the Aloadae, once manage to kidnap Ares and imprison him in a bronze jar for thirteen months. Homer says that if their stepmother Eriboea hadn’t told Hermes about it, this would have spelled the end of Ares.
</p>
<h3>Ares and Aphrodite</h3>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTaB1Rxfo5_cXsTPYY6PBbYk0eZ-6Fquzvf2b3O0HTVtG3DSePj&usqp=CAU" alt="Ares">
<p>
Ares had many women, but none of his affairs was as famous as the one he had with Aphrodite. At the time, the goddess of beauty was married to Ares’ brother, Hephaestus, who was told by Helios of his wife’s transgressions. Hephaestus fashioned a delicate, almost invisible, bronze net, which he put on the bed where Ares and Aphrodite were supposed to lie. When they finally did in his absence, he stormed into the room with a host of gods. The Olympians laughed for days at the helplessly entrapped lovers.<br>
However, it seems that in this case, Ares had the last laugh, since Aphrodite bore him at least three and as many as eight children. Hesiod lists only Deimos, Phobos, and Harmonia. Later authors include Adrestia and some or all of the four Erotes: Eros, Anteros, Pothos, and Himeros.
</p>
<h3>Ares’ Companions and Other Children</h3>
<p>
Ares can rarely be seen alone on the battlefield. He is typically joined by a bloodthirsty crowd, a number of infernal associates symbolizing the terror of war. His sons Deimos (Panic or Dread) and Phobos (Fear) are almost always beside him. The same holds true for Ares’ “comrade and sister” Eris (Strife) and Enyo (the Sacker of Cities and “sister of war”). Sometimes, Kydoimos appears as well – the personification of the confusion and muddle of battle. Most frighteningly, so do the Keres, the grim-eyed female Spirits of Death, dressed in cloaks crimson with human blood.<br>
Ares was associated with many bellicose heroes in Greek mythology, such as the aforementioned Cycnus or Diomedes of Thrace, whose man-eating mares Heracles was supposed to capture as his eight labor. Probably with his daughter Harmonia, Ares fathered a whole race of warriors: the Amazons. Otrera gave him the most famous four: Hippolyta, Antiope, Melanippe, and Penthesilea.

<h2 id="hephaestus">Hephaestus</h2>

<hr>
<p>
Hephaestus is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors, carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his Roman counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes. Even though an ugly god lamed by his own mother, he was the husband of none other than Aphrodite herself.
</p>
<h3>Role</h3>
<p>
It is not known what the name Hephaestus means. However, since it’s similar to few pre-Greek toponyms (Phaistos), it is supposed that Hephaestus is a very old deity.<br>
He is arguably the most extraordinary member of the Olympian Pantheon. Bearded and ugly, stocky and lame, he neither possesses the physical flawlessness of the other gods nor does he stimulate the fitting respect. Sometimes he is depicted with an oval cap and almost always with a hammer and an anvil.<br>
The epithets most commonly associated with Hephaestus are far from flattering: “the lame one” and “the halting.” He is also sometimes referred to as “shrewd” and habitually as the “Aetnaean,” since his workshop was believed to be located under Mount Aetna.
</p>
<h3>Hephaestus’ Family and Difficult Childhood</h3>
<p>
Homer says that Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera. However, he is unclear whether he was born lame or whether he was lamed after his father threw him from Olympus for intervening on behalf of his mother during a quarrel between Zeus and Hera.<br>
Hesiod, however, claims that Hephaestus is solely Hera’s child and that she gave him birth by parthenogenesis to get back at her husband who had done the same with Athena. In this version of the story, after bringing him to the world, Hera was so disgusted with Hephaestus’ looks and ashamed of his deformity that she was the one who threw him out. Hephaestus was severely hurt from the fall, but he was rescued by Thetis and Eurynome, who sheltered him in a cave under the Ocean for the following nine years.<br>
Later on, Hephaestus got his revenge. He made a golden throne, so beautiful that Hera accepted it right away. However, the minute she sat on it, she was all tied up by the numerous delicately fashioned cords invisible to anyone’s eyes but their creator’s. Many gods tried to persuade Hephaestus to free Hera, promising him a place on Olympus in return. However, he was unremorseful and released his mother only when Dionysus got him drunk.
</p>
<h3>Hephaestus as a Craftsman</h3>
<p>
Just like Hera’s golden throne, Hephaestus’ creations were masterworks.<br>
No one but him was able to build the beautiful, indestructible bronze mansions where all the other Olympians lived. Crafty and cunning, he added a distinctive element here and there, such as the secure doors of Hera’s chamber which no other god but her could open.<br>
In the “Iliad,” Homer tells us something even more fascinating. Namely, that Hephaestus had fashioned for himself handmaidens of gold, who were able to understand him, speak to him and assist him. And they weren’t the only creations of this kind. Among other automata, Hephaestus sculpted golden dogs to guard the palace of Alcinous and Talos, a giant bronze man to protect Crete. Some even say that, at the request of Zeus, he also sculpted the first mortal woman, Pandora.<br>
Finally, Hephaestus was the creator of some of the most stunning pieces of military equipment ever seen. Most famously, as a favor to Thetis, he created the shield of Achilles, whose five bronze layers he masterfully engraved with scenes representing almost all aspects of life. But he was also the one who made the scepter of Agamemnon, the breast-plate of Diomedes, and the sword of Peleus.
</p>
<h3>Hephaestus’ Women and Children</h3>
<p>
For an ugly god, Hephaestus couldn’t have fared much better when it comes to women.<br>
Most commonly, his wife is said to have been none other than Aphrodite, the Goddess of Beauty herself. However, she wasn’t very faithful to him, sleeping with Ares behind his back. One day, Hephaestus caught the lovers and trapped them in a fine-woven chain-net, after which he called upon the other gods to laugh at their shame. Poseidon persuaded him to free the adulterers, but Hephaestus wasn’t done. When Ares and Aphrodite’s daughter Harmonia married Cadmus, he gifted her a magical necklace which would bring misfortune to her and everyone who will afterward wear it.<br>
Other authors say that Hephaestus was married to Aglaea, the youngest of the Graces. She gave him four children: Eucleia, Euthenia, Eupheme, and Philophrosyne.<br>
One time, Hephaestus tried to force himself upon Athena. Athena managed to escape on time, so Hephaestus’ seed fell on the earth and impregnated Gaea, who afterward gave birth to Erichthonius, an early ruler of Athens.

<h2 id="hermes">Hermes</h2>
<hr>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfePPQzW4AAXW7r.jpg" alt="Hermes">
<hr>
<p>
Hermes is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads, flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the lyre and stole Apollo’s cattle on the very first day of his life. Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between the living and the dead.
</p>
<h3>Role</h3>
<p>
Most scholars think that Hermes’ name derives from the Greek word herma, which means “a heap of stones” or “cairn.” Cairns were a common sight in the Ancient world, serving as trail- or boundary-markers. Some say that the first cairn was erected by the gods, when they cast all their stones in favor of Hermes, during his trial for slaying Argus Panoptes.<br>
Archaic artists portrayed Hermes as a mature bearded man. However, later on, he was represented as an athletically built nude youth, immediately recognizable by four attributes: a broad-brimmed hat (petasos), winged sandals (talaria), a purse, and a herald’s wand (kerykeion, or caduceus in Latin). Hermes’ wand – a short-winged staff, entangled by two identical serpents – had magical powers, bringing sleep upon people or rousing them from it. It is very similar and frequently confused with the Rod of Asclepius, which is why Hermes’ wand is often incorrectly used as a symbol of medicine.<br>
According to some myths, Hermes wasn’t only a messenger of the gods, but also the inventor of speech. As such, he is often associated with oratory or interpretation. In Greece, an interpreter was called hermeneus, and today the science of interpretation is known as hermeneutics.<br>
Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the boundary between the living and the dead and carrying the souls of the dead in Hades. In time, he came to be known as “the conductor” or “the leader of souls.” People also called him “patron of travelers and thieves,” “shepherd of men,” “trickster,” and “Argus-slayer.”
</p>
<h3>Hermes’ Life and Deeds</h3>
<p>
A Precocious Child
Hermes was the son of Zeus and Maia, the oldest of the seven Pleiades. He was born in a cave in Mount Cyllene in Arcadia at dawn. By noon he was able to invent the lyre and play a hymn celebrating his own birth on it. That very same evening, for reasons unknown, he stole the cattle of Apollo. Afterward, he came back and innocently tucked himself up in his cradle.

Hermes and Apollo
To invent the lyre, Hermes killed a tortoise and scooped the flesh out of its shell. Then, honoring the Pleiades, he stretched seven strings of sheep-gut over the empty shell. Once he found out who had stolen his cattle, Apollo was so angry at Hermes that bad things might have happened if Hermes hadn’t appeased Apollo with a lyre- accompanied song. In exchange for it, Apollo forgave his little brother everything and swore to be his closest friend forevermore. Some say that as a token of this promise, Apollo gifted Hermes with the latter one’s most emblematic object: the caduceus.

Hermes, a Darling of the Gods
By all accounts, Hermes was a darling of the gods. Artemis supposedly taught him how to hunt and Pan how to play the pipes. He was the one who guided Persephone back to her mother, Demeter. Above all, Hermes was very close with his father, acting in many of his affairs as Zeus’ wingman. Most famously, he beheaded the hundred-eyed giant Argus Panoptes, previously sent by Hera to closely watch over Zeus’ love interest Io.

Hermes, the Messenger
In his role as a messenger, Hermes is present in numerous other myths. He escorts Pandora to Epimetheus, leads Perseus to the Graeae, and guides Priam safely to Achilles’ tent. In addition, he showed Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera the way to Mount Ida where Paris was supposed to judge which one of them was the fairest.
</p>
<h3>Hermes’ Women and Children</h3>
<p>
Even though associated with fertility, it seems that Hermes never married, and had relatively few famous consorts and children. Aphrodite bore him Hermaphrodites and possibly Tyche, Herse – Cephalus, and the nymph Dryope – Pan. Later poets sometimes link Hermes with Peitho or Hecate.<br>
Once, Hermes and Apollo fell in love simultaneously with the virgin Chione and slept with her on the very same day. Later, Chione gave birth to twins. Philammon took after Apollo and became a famous musician. Unsurprisingly, Hermes’ son Autolycus became a trickster and a thief. Poets say that not few of his traits were inherited by his grandson: Odysseus.

	 <i>He is the writer of the Illiad and the Odessey. Although these two great epic poems of ancient Greece have always been attributed to the shadowy figure of Homer, little is known of him beyond the fact that his was the name attached in antiquity by the Greeks themselves to the poems. That there was an epic poet called Homer and that he played the primary part in shaping the Iliad and the Odyssey—so much may be said to be probable.
